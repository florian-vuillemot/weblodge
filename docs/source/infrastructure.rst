Manage your WebLodge-deployed application
#########################################

Managing and updating is a daily infrastructure task with no visible value for the end user.
**WebLodge** uses an Azure `Platform as a Service`_ resource named `Azure App Service`_
to keep your infrastructure as secure, up-to-date and reliable as possible.
This tool keeps your infrastructure at the state-of-the-art, allowing you to focus on your application's functionality.

But whatever your infrastructure tools are, it's your responsibility to keep your application secure and your dependencies up-to-date.
